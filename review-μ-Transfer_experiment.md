# Exploring µ-Parameterization in Large-Scale Neural Networks

## Introduction

In the field of artificial intelligence, especially in natural language processing and computer vision, large neural network models have become a cornerstone. However, the initialization and learning rates of these models are often determined through heuristic methods, varying significantly between different studies and model sizes. This inconsistency can lead to suboptimal performance, particularly when scaling up models.

The concept of **µ-Parameterization (µP)** provides a potential solution to this problem. µP offers scaling rules for model initialization and learning rates, enabling zero-shot hyperparameter transfer from small models to larger ones. This technique promises stable training and optimal hyperparameters at scale with minimal cost. Despite its potential, µP has not been widely adopted due to its complexity and the need for further empirical validation.

In this blog post, we delve into the details of µ-Parameterization, its underlying principles, and its practical applications as explored in the paper "A Large-Scale Exploration of µ-Transfer" by Lucas Dax Lingle.

## What is µ-Parameterization?

### Concept and Principles

µ-Parameterization (µP) is a set of rules for initializing neural networks and setting learning rates that allows for the seamless transfer of hyperparameters from small proxy models to larger target models. This approach is grounded in a Gaussian Process interpretation of deep neural networks, where the width of the network (number of neurons per layer) is a critical factor.

The core idea is to scale the initialization and learning rates based on the width of the network. The general formulation of µP when training with the Adam optimizer and using an i.i.d. Gaussian initialization is as follows:

1. **Initialization Variance**: Parameters are initialized with a variance that scales inversely with the width of the layer. For example, if the width of a layer is ***M***, then the initialization variance for weight matrices  ***W<sub>AQ</sub>, W<sub>AK</sub>, W<sub>AV</sub>*** is $\frac{1}{M}$.

2. **Learning Rate**: The learning rate for each parameter is scaled based on the width of the network. For instance, the learning rate for the same weight matrices ***W<sub>AQ</sub>, W<sub>AK</sub>, W<sub>AV</sub>*** is ***$\frac{\alpha P}{M}$***, where ***$\alpha$*** is the base learning rate and ***P*** is a fixed proxy model width.

These scaling rules ensure that the behavior of small and large models remains consistent, facilitating the transfer of optimal hyperparameters across different model sizes.



### Practical Implementation

In practical terms, µP involves specific scaling rules for various components of a transformer model, which is a popular architecture in NLP and computer vision. For example, the initialization variance for the weight matrices in the attention mechanism and MLP blocks is set according to the width of the model. Similarly, the learning rate is adjusted to maintain consistent training dynamics across different scales.

Below is an example of µP scaling rules for transformers:

| Parameter | Initialization Variance | Adam Learning Rate |
|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------|
| `WE`      | 1                        | α                  |
| `WAQ`     | 1/M                      | αP/M               |
| `WAK`     | 1/M                      | αP/M               |
| `WAV`     | 1/M                      | αP/M               |
| `WAO`     | 1/(HD)                   | αP/M               |
| `WFI`     | 1/M                      | αP/M               |
| `WFO`     | 1/F                      | αP/M               |
| `WU`      | 1/M²                     | αP/M               |

*Table 1: µP scaling rules for transformers.*

In this table, `M` represents the model width, `H` the number of heads, `D` the head width, `F` the hidden width of the MLP, and `α` the base learning rate.

## µ-Transfer

One of the significant advantages of µ-Parameterization is the concept of µ-Transfer. This method allows hyperparameters, such as learning rates, found optimal in small models to be transferred directly to larger models without the need for extensive re-tuning. This process is particularly beneficial for scaling models efficiently and maintaining consistent performance across different model sizes.

### Steps in µ-Transfer

1. **Training a Small Proxy Model**: Begin by training a small proxy model, which is easier and less expensive to experiment with. Perform hyperparameter tuning on this model to find the optimal learning rate and other hyperparameters. For instance, let's denote the optimal learning rate found for this small model as \( \alpha \).

2. **Scaling the Hyperparameters**: Use the scaling rules provided by µP to adapt the hyperparameters for a larger model. The key scaling rule here is that the learning rate should be adjusted based on the ratio of the widths of the large model to the small model. For example, if the small model has a width \( 128 \) and the large model has a width \( 2048 \), the scaled learning rate for the large model would be \( \frac{\alpha \cdot 2048}{128} \).

3. **Applying the Scaled Hyperparameters**: Implement these scaled hyperparameters in the larger model. This involves adjusting the initialization variance and learning rates according to the µP rules to ensure that the training dynamics remain stable and consistent.

### Benefits of µ-Transfer

- **Efficiency**: By using µ-Transfer, researchers can avoid the costly and time-consuming process of hyperparameter tuning on large models. Instead, they can perform this tuning on smaller models and scale the results.
  
- **Consistency**: µ-Transfer helps maintain consistent training dynamics across different model sizes. This consistency is crucial for achieving optimal performance as models scale up.

- **Simplicity**: The process of scaling hyperparameters using µP is straightforward once the initial tuning on the small model is complete. This simplicity can significantly reduce the complexity of managing large-scale model training.

## Ablation Experiment

### Setup & objective
The objective of these experiments is to examine how various methods that can enhance performance affect the actual transfer of learning rates from smaller width models to larger models with µP and their impact on performance in reality. While the existing µP aimed at transferring initialization and learning rates, this experiment focuses on the learning rate, an important hyperparameter in large transformer models. <br/>
The experiments are implemented using Jax/Flax on TPU V3, and the optimal learning rate is determined by measuring the validation loss. Models with widths of $M$ = {128, 512, 2048} have parameters ranging from 4.7M to 1.2B, with the depth fixed at L = 24. The reason for focusing solely on width and not depth is that in the case of depthwise µP, only one linear layer is used per residual block, whereas transformers use at least two layers. So, in this experiment, width is the main change to control the # of parameters.<br/>


### baseline & Summary
![baseline](https://github.com/simct/test/assets/127532891/5c0e4f35-043c-4e1f-abbf-9b166b457fbb)
The baseline represents the experimental results used as a reference for performance improvement or degradation across various experimental settings. In the baseline using µP, it is confirmed that the optimal learning rate for the smallest model is also the optimal learning rate for larger models that are 4x wider (16x larger).<br/>
The experimental results can be categorized into three main groups:
1.  **Transfer O, Performance Improvement O**
-   Cases where both learning rate transfer and performance improvement is observed.
 -  Examples:
	    Zero query initialization, Multiplicative Nonlinearities, SP unembedding initialization, Multi-query attention, batch size(4x)
2. **Transfer O, Performance Improvement X**
-   Cases where learning rate transfer, but there was no improvement in performance.
-   Examples:
		Projection biases, Embedding normalization, Cosine schedule
3. **Transfer X**
-   Cases where learning rate does not transfer.
 -  Examples:
	    RMS Norm gain, Decoupled weight decay, SP attention scale


Cases where learning rate does not transfer are not separately classified with performance improvement, as performance improvement in these cases is not significant.

### Projection Biases

![projectionbiases](https://github.com/simct/test/assets/127532891/5b7d2003-bf2f-4035-9458-4e0ead6a93d5) <br/>

Adding a bias vector to the linear layer does not guarantee an improvement in model performance. In fact, experimental results showed that the performance was similar to that of the baseline and learning rate transfer across the model size and width under µP. 


### RMS Norm gain(vector & scalar) & Embedding normalization
![RMSNorm](https://github.com/simct/test/assets/127532891/34223422-3755-487e-9221-c2beaa3cfc15)
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.07467">RMSNorm</a> is a normalization method that uses the root mean square instead of the mean and standard deviation. <br/>
*** \mu = \dfrac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i, \sigma = \sqrt{\dfrac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-\mu)^2)} *** <br/>
To obtain the output after normalization, a trainable gain and bias are used. The gain can be implemented in two forms: a vector gain and a scalar multiplier. Similar to projection bias, the use of a trainable gain does not guarantee performance improvement.<br/>
The results showed that transfer does not occur in any case, and performance degradation is observed in the models with the largest width.<br/>
On the other hand, using normalized embedding with RMSNorm without a trainable gain did not improve performance, but it was observed that the learning rate transfer was successful.


### Query Initialization
![zeroquery](https://github.com/simct/test/assets/127532891/cda1bb9e-df4d-4d95-9a42-6841e87754b8)
For query projection, µP initialization typically uses a Gaussian distribution with variance $\Theta(1/M)$, but zero-initialization has been proposed to facilitate transfer. Transfer occurs with zero-initialized query, and there was a slight improvement in performance compared to the baseline, traditional Gaussian initialization.

### Cosine schedule
![cosineschedule](https://github.com/simct/test/assets/127532891/66ec153d-b017-4791-8787-4dba0176ab83)
Adjusting the learning rate over iterations is an open problem with no definitive solution, with methods like power and exponential scheduling. This experiment use cosine scheduling, which is the method that periodically decreases and increases the learning rate to prevent convergence to local minima. This approach can help the model escape suboptimal points and potentially find better solutions.The baseline used a linear schedule, but switching to cosine scheduling did not negatively impact transfer. However, a slight performance degradation was observed with cosine scheduling compared to the baseline.

### Decoupled weight decay
![weightdecay](https://github.com/simct/test/assets/127532891/4d7d83cf-03a5-434f-8456-ee34a26e067e)
When optimizing hyperparameters with Adam, the decoupled weight decay method separates the weight decay from the optimization step, allowing independent exploration of the learning rate and weight decay factor. Experimental results using decoupled weight decay show that optimal learning rate transfer is not achieved. A large $\lambda$ value is suggested as a potential cause for this issue. In this experiment, $\lambda = 0.1$ was used. The smaller difference in optimal learning rates between small and large models, compared to other transfer failures, suggests that reducing $\lambda$ may help resolve the transfer problem.

### Multiplicative Nonlinearities
![nonlinear](https://github.com/simct/test/assets/127532891/b7ff437a-e3be-4bcf-9df4-74e51d2fac73)
To enhance the performance of transformers, multiplicative nonlinearity activation functions such as SwiGLU and Squared ReLU can be utilized. SwiGLU is an activation function created by combining the Swish activation function with the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) and is considered to get better performance compared to traditional activation methods. . The formulas for each are as follows: <br/>
$Swish(x) = x\sigma (\beta x)$ ($\sigma$ : sigmoid function, $\beta$ : trainable parameter )<br/>
$GLU(x,W,V,b,c) = \sigma(xW+b)\otimes (xV+c)$ ($W,V$ : trainable tensor, $b,c$: trainable tensor bias, $\otimes$ : element-wise multiplication)<br/>

Similarly, Squared ReLU, which is obtained by squaring the ReLU activation function, is known to help improve performance. Experimental results show that they allow µ-transfer of the learning rate across model sizes  and unlike the RMSNorm gain, there is performance improvements  from the perspective of multiplicative interaction.

### Standard Parameterization
![SPpart](https://github.com/simct/test/assets/127532891/a2d6ed4a-b628-485d-8491-840cc1d3ebc9)
Yang et al. (2021) state that µP models perform better than SP models, and our various experiments with SP settings confirm that some of the µP settings offer advantages in terms of transfer and model performance.<br/>
- attention scale<br/>
Usual attention scaling is $\tau^{-1} = 1/\sqrt{D}$, while µP proposes $\tau^{-1} = \Theta(1/D)$, and baseline experiment is implemented using a simple $(1/D$) scaling. In this experiment, attention scaling is $1/\sqrt{D}$ to check the SP setting. For the $M = 128$ model, the optimal learning rate is $2^{-8}$, but for larger models, the optimal learning rate is changed to $2^{-6}$. This means that transfer did not occur, and performance slightly deteriorate compared to the original baseline.
- unembedding initialization<br/>
The initialization of µP's unembedding matrix follows a Gaussian distribution with a variance of $\Theta(1/M^2)$, while standard parametrization (SP) uses $1/M$. Experiments using the original SP method with $1/M$ show that transfer was maintained and there was a slight improvement in performance for larger models. <br/>
![SP](https://github.com/simct/test/assets/127532891/597b6eef-f507-4d5c-884b-710602e45245)
To compare the result of the SP and µP,  this experiment is implemented using SP and compare the result with baseline's. The differences between the baseline and SP include using trainable biases in linear layers, trainable gains in RMSNorm layers, attention scale $1/\sqrt{D}$, and unembedding initialization variance $1/M$. All other hyperparameters remain the same. The combined results for SP transformers show that transfer does not occur, and the optimal loss is lower in performance compared to the baseline. 

### Lion Optimizer
![Lion](https://github.com/simct/test/assets/127532891/1998e992-833b-4d15-94b3-45594cd04931)
<a href="https://github.com/lucidrains/lion-pytorch">The Lion optimizer</a> is known for being more than twice as memory-efficient as Adam while delivering similar performance in transformers. This optimizer restricts updates to $\{-1, 1\}$ for each coordinate, yielding a coordinate size of $\Theta(1)$ per step. Consequently, it seems suitable to use the existing $\Theta(1/M)$ transfer rule as it is. However, experimental results show that the learning rate transfer is not successful, indicating the need for further research on the transfer rule.

### Multi-query attention
![multiquery](https://github.com/simct/test/assets/127532891/70a24d8d-0692-458b-8049-b866b81760b7)
Transformer LLMs can use multi-query attention and group generalization to increase inference speed. Experimental results show that these methods lead to significant performance improvements compared to other methods, and transfer also occurred effectively.

### Batch Size(4x larger, 4x smaller)
![Batchsize](https://github.com/simct/test/assets/127532891/6e6e29f0-4edd-4ccd-b650-fa5abe0b1d47)
By adjusting the batch size while keeping the number of training tokens constant, it is possible to reduce training time or determine the minimum batch size required for operation. In this case, the learning rate formula is adapted by using twice the specified value for 4x larger batch sizes and half the value for 4x smaller batch sizes. The results show that learning rate transfer effectively in both cases, though further research is needed to determine the optimal batch size.

### Larger scale model
![large](https://github.com/simct/test/assets/127532891/1a114701-44f0-4444-b73e-800c5db44e40)<br/>
To verify if transfer is possible over a larger scale difference, experiments is implemented by reducing $L$ to 12 and setting the width to $\{128, 512, 2048, 8192\}$, resulting in models with 2M, 40M, 600M, and 10B parameters.  Zero query and Squared ReLU are used, which show good performance and does not negatively impact transfer. The results confirm that, despite a 5000x scale difference, the learning rate transfer well.

# Conclusion

The paper aim to demonstrate that the transfer properties observed in the baseline with µP can be maintained across most scenarios. It also shows that µP outperforms standard parameterization (SP) and confirms the efficacy of part-by-part transfer for elements like attention scale and unembedding initialization, thereby validating the superiority of µ. Furthermore, it shows that transfer is feasible for models ranging from 2M to 10B parameters, suggesting applicability to larger models.<br/>
However, some issues are identified where optimal learning rate transfer does not occur, or performance decline in large models. For example, trainable RMSNorm gain and decoupled weight decay does not function properly for learning rate transfer. Although transfer is observed with projection biases and cosine scheduling, there is no performance improvement or even a decline.<br/>
The significance of this paper lies in summarizing the impact of various methods on performance and transfer under µ through ablation experiments. Nonetheless, a limitation is the focus on many ablations without conducting additional experiments for more detailed results. Although results are summarized in tables, comprehensive analysis is lacking. For instance, in cases where transfer fail, the differences in optimal learning rates between small and large models were relatively minor, suggesting potential for achieving transfer with further exploration or improvement. However, no additional experiments is implemented to investigate these possibilities.<br/>
The paper acknowledges the limitations of some experiments and suggests further research, indicating a need for more extensive studies in these areas.


## Conclusion

µ-Parameterization represents a significant advancement in the scalability and efficiency of training large neural networks. By providing a robust method for transferring hyperparameters from small to large models, µP simplifies the training process and ensures more consistent performance. While further research is needed to address its limitations and expand its applicability, µP offers a promising direction for future developments in AI model training.
